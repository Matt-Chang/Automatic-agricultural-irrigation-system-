# Automatic-agricultural-irrigation-system

Developed and implemented a comprehensive data pipeline to automate the data updating process from over 190,000 hydrographic stations, facilitating the generation of accurate water usage metrics for irrigation purposes.

Key Achievements:

Established an efficient system to collect and process data from a vast network of hydrographic stations.
Ensured seamless data integration and synchronization for timely updates.
Successfully generated water usage metrics for over 190,000 farmlands.
Enhanced accuracy and reliability of water usage data through automated processes.
Goals:

Improve Data Collection: Implement a robust mechanism to collect data from hydrographic stations efficiently.
Streamline Data Processing: Develop an automated data processing system to handle the large volume of information gathered from the hydrographic stations.
Ensure Timely Updates: Establish a synchronized process to update the data promptly, allowing for real-time monitoring and analysis.
Enhance Accuracy: Implement data quality checks and validation techniques to ensure reliable water usage metrics for irrigation purposes.
By implementing this project, I successfully built a complete data pipeline that achieved the goals of efficient data collection, streamlined processing, timely updates, and improved accuracy. This project significantly contributed to providing valuable insights into water usage for irrigation in over 190,000 farmlands.
